Learn to design a multi-format book from one XHTML source file using CSS. Multi-format outputs include: print PDF, print-on-demand PDF, screen PDF, mobile-first Web using Bootstrap, and eBook formats EPUB 2 / 3 and AZW3 / KF8 for Kindle.

The CSS book layout method can be integrated into any workflow or CMS as long as you can provide an XHTML file. The CSS/XHTML combo with GitHub revisioning has a number of advantages, it means text and graphics editors can carry on working away on one file set while you work on layout; you can create a CSS layout library that means speedy layouts can be applied to new projects; and finally you can adopt a free and open source workflow saying goodbye to proprietary and expensive software licenses.

Over the duration of the course you will make a small book.

No prior experience needed, just bring a laptop.
